## üìÇ Coursework

- **Attendance (5%)**  
  Your presence in class is important. Attendance will be tracked throughout the course and will contribute 5% to your final grade.

- **Class Participation (5%)**  
  Active participation in discussions and in-class activities is highly encouraged. This includes contributing meaningfully to classroom conversations, group discussions, and peer feedback.

- **Literature Review (45%)**  
  A significant portion of your grade will be based on a thorough literature review. The review should focus on existing work in the field of generative models and their applications. Details on the structure, submission, and grading criteria will be provided in the assignments section.

- **Course Project (45%)**  
  The course project is designed to give you hands-on experience with generative AI models. You will be required to develop a project that incorporates diffusion models and aligns with your academic or research interests. 
  <!-- More information regarding the project expectations, milestones, and deliverables can be found on [the project page](#). -->

> Students are encouraged to create innovative projects that integrate generative models with their respective academic disciplines, aiming for interdisciplinary applications.
